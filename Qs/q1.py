#  Process a csv flle, filter invalid record and aggregate a column 

import csv
import pandas as pd

try:
  df = pd.read_csv('transaction.csv')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: CSV file not found.")
    exit()


# Define criteria for valid records and filter the DataFrame accordingly to filter out rows/invalid records.
# example, if transaction amounts must be positive:
df_filtered = df[df['amount'] > 0]
# Filter out rows where 'column_name' is empty or negative
df_filtered = df[df['column_name'] > 0].dropna(subset=['column_name'])


# Use the groupby() method to group the DataFrame by a specific column and then apply an aggregation function (e.g., sum, mean, count) to another column.
# Example: Calculate the sum of 'sales' for each 'customer'
df_aggregated = df_filtered.groupby('customer')['sales'].sum().reset_index()

# Aggregation works with only numeric type columns.
df_aggregated = df_filtered.get['customer'].aggregate(['sales'])

# The df_aggregated DataFrame now contains the aggregated data, which we can print, save to a new CSV file, or use for further analysis.
print(df_aggregated)
# df_aggregated.to_csv('aggregated_data.csv', index=False)
